    <p><em><strong>Shadow over Innsmouth</strong></em> is a horror novella by American author 
        <strong>H. P. Lovecraft</strong>, written in Novemberâ€“December 1931. It forms part of 
        the Cthulhu Mythos, using its motif of a malign undersea civilization, and references 
        several shared elements of the Mythos, including place-names, mythical creatures, and 
        invocations. The Shadow over Innsmouth is the only Lovecraft story that was published 
        in book form during his lifetime.

    <p>The narrator is a student conducting an antiquarian tour of New England. He travels 
        through the nearby decrepit seaport of Innsmouth which is suggested as a cheaper 
        and potentially interesting next leg of his journey. There he interacts with 
        strange people and observes disturbing events that ultimately lead to horrifying 
        and personal revelations.
